* LEC 1: Introduction

```
1. What is a distributed system?
  > Multiple cooperating computers 
  > storage for big web sites, MapReduce, peer-to-peer sharing, 
  > lots of critical infrastructure is distributed.
  
2. Why do people build distributed systems?
  > to increase capacity via parallelism 
  > to tolerate faults via replication 
  > to place computing physically close to external entities
  > to achieve security via isolation. 

3. Main Topics?
  > Storage 
  > Comunication 
  > Computation 
  > Performance 
  > Fault tolerance 
  > Consistency

```

* Lab 3: fault-tolerant key/value store 

```
```

* Lab 4: shared key/value store
